            <h4>FRONT-END DEVELOPMENT</h4>
            <p>I have extensive knowledge of HTML, CSS & JavaScript (ES6), TypeScript and experience with the 3 most popular frameworks (React, Vue & Angular*). Add ambition, endless curiosity and a GTDâ€‘mindset and you have a pretty complete picture of me.</p>

            <h4>DIGITAL DESIGNER</h4>
            <p>I speak the designer mumbo-jumbo and dare to make design decisions while coding. This saves valuable development time, endless ping-ponging with designers and often looks even better than the original design. I also do not hesitate to work out something in Figma or Sketch myself.</p>
